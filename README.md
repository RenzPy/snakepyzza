Being a beginner i want to start my journey with a python game project to expand my knowledge.

Here's of what it will consist of :

- Snake style game
    - Snake moves in the Y and X axis when user inputs direction ✅
    - Balls spawns randomly in the map ✅
    - Snake eats ball ✅
    - Snake gets bigger ✅
    - Snake touches it's own body = RIP ✅

Graphic wise :

- Snake has a chef hat (maybe mustache? , very stereotypical) ❌
- Ball is pizza . ✅


Let's do this.
