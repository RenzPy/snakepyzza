# snakepyzza

Being a beginner i want to start my journey with a python game project to expand my knowledge.

Here's of what it will consist of :

- Snake style game
    - snake moves in the Y and X axis when user inputs direction
    - balls spawns randomly in the map ,
    - snake eats ball
    - snake gets bigger
    - snake touches it's own body = RIP

Graphic wise :

- Snake has a chef hat (maybe mustache? , very stereotypical)
- Ball is pizza .


Let's do this.
